# Project-06: Continuous Integration with AWS

### Objectives:

- In this project, instead of jenkins as countinous integration server we will use AWS managed services to build and test our source code. 

- This will reduce the operational overhead to manage the servers deployed for jenkins, nexus repository and sonarqube.


### Tools/Services Used:

- AWS CodeCommit
- AWS CodeBuild
- AWS CodeArtifact
- AWS CodePipeline
- AWS Systems Manager
- AWS S3 
- SonarCloud
