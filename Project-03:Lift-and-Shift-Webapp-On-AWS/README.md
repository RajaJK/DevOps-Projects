# Project-03: Lift and Shift the WebApplication on AWS 

In this project we will setup the web application stack on the AWS cloud.

Following AWS services will be used 

- EC2
- ELB
- Auto Scaling 
- EBS/EFS
- Route53
- IAM
- ACM
- S3 

### Flow of execution:

- Login to the AWS account.
- Create key pair to access the instances.
- Create Security groups, so that only required ports will be opened on the instances. 
- Launch the EC2 instances with userdata.
- Update the IP addresses in Route53. 
- Build the application from the source code.
- Upload the artifact to S3 storage.
- Download the artifact from S3 to EC2 tomcat instance.
- Setup the ELB with HTTPS (Use ACM for SSL certifiacte).
- Map the ELB endpoint url to website name in DNS provider (e.g. GoDaddy).
- Verify the application.
